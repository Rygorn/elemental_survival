# elemental_survival
A Mod that brings back hot, cold, wet survival aspects to the game.


## Dev Setup

To build this mod, you'll need to copy these DLLs from your game install into a local `lib/` folder:

- `0Harmony.dll` — from `Mods/0_TFP_Harmony/`

- `Assembly-CSharp.dll`,
- `UnityEngine.dll`, 
- `UnityEngine.CoreModule.dll`,
- `LogLibrary.dll`, — from `7DaysToDie_Data/Managed/`

These DLLs are not included in the repo and must be sourced from your own game installation.
